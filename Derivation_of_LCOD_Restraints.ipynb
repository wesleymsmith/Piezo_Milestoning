    "## Cell Boundary / Occupancy derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary equations / restraints for each cell can be modeled based upon the triangulation. \n",
    "Specifically, for each pair of connected cells, we can construct an inclusion test by taking the midpoint\n",
    "of the two cell centers then computing the normal vector, n, directed from the midpoint, m, between the two cell centers c1 and c2 to a given cell center (either c1 or c2) i.e. n1 = c1-m, n2 = c2-m. Then any point in space, r, we say that r is on the same side of the dividing plane as cell 1 if dot( (r-m), n1 )>0 or r is in on the same side of the dividing plane as cell 2 if dot( (r-m), n2 ) >0.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can then compute cell occupancy conditions for each cell as the union over all the half plane inclusion conditions for that cell center to each connected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for an N dimensional triangulation, each half plane inclusion condition is defined by a set of 2N numbers, the first N define the coordinates of the centeroid, m, and the second N define the normal vector n pointing from m to the cell being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for a given central cell, i, and test cell, j, we can compute whether coordinate r is cloer to i than to j:\n",

    "    \\delta_{ij} = [(r-c_{ij}) \\cdot (R_i-c_{ij})>0]\n",
    "\\label{eq:halfPlane_dotProduct_inequality} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "where $\\delta_{ij}$ is equal to 1 if $r$ is closer to $i$ than to $j$ and 0 if not, $c_{ij}$ is the position vector of the midpoint between cell i and cell j, and $R_i$ is the position vector of cell i\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this we can then test each point ion coordinate from our data set to determine which cells it belongs to (i.e. for which cells does it pass all half plane inclusion tests).\n",
    "Importantly, this will allow us to make sure that no ion coordinates belong to more than one cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can plot our cell occupancy as above and color any ion coordinates that occupy multiply cells in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an important note, the inclusion equation above can be expressed as a linear combination of triangulation space coordinates (Distance PCA modes) plus / minus a constant. And since the triangulation space coordinates, being distance PCA modes, are themselves linear combinations of our distances, the inclusion equations can be recast as intervals over LCOD restraints using our defined distances!\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we first note that we will need to recast our above expression in terms of an inequality over some linear combination of distance coordinates, while at present we have an inequality involving the dotproduct of vectors in PCA space, the bases of which are linear combinations of the distance coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this derivation, we first convert from vector dot product notation into an explicit summation over PCA modes, then recast into LCOD notation recasting each PCA mode as a sum over distance coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get $\\delta_{ij}$ as an explicit sum over every PCA mode, $k$, we write:\n",
